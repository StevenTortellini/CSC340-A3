    <h1>About us</h1> <br>
    <p>DoggyDaycare was founded by Steven Torres in the fall of 2020.<br>
        He was taking care of the family dog while the rest of the family was out of town. <br>
        His friends took notice and one by one they eached asked if he could watch their dogs. <br>
        By the end of the day he was left with 8 dogs he had to look after. In disbelief he exclaimed "It looks like a DoggyDaycare in here" and thats when the idea was born. <br>
        Our first location opened summer of 2021 and it been a good time since.
        We are proud to serve the triad area with the best quality care for your dogs. <br>
